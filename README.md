## Notes:

- How much time it took?:  

It took approximately three hours of work to complete. However, the entire exercise required more time due to issues with the TikTok-Api. I encountered a problem with the playwright package, which is a dependency for TikTok-Api, and resolving it took about 90 minutes. Additionally, I spent significant time reviewing the TikTok-Api documentation to find an API method that allows fetching user data using a user ID.

- Issues/challenges you faced:  

I encountered numerous issues with the playwright package, a dependency for TikTok-Api. I spent a considerable amount of time identifying that the problem was with the package itself and that only a specific version could resolve it. Additionally, I devoted significant time to reviewing the TikTok-Api documentation to find an API method that allows fetching user data using a user ID.

- database design: 
 
I used SQLite to design my database, creating a single table for storing user information.  

- Possible ways to improve the api:  
A potential improvement for the API would be to utilize the official TikTok APIs.

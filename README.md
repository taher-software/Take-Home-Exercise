- FLask
- TikTok-Api

## Getting Started

**To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:**

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Setup

- Make sure to create a virtual environment using this command line:

```
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

- Clone the repo using this command line:

``` sh
  git clone git@gitlab.com:veolia.com/vesa/ada/ada-dataform-data-quality.git

```

### Install

```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### First Time
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

### Run

```
  python main.py
```

### Deployement
``` command line
  gcloud run deploy datadesk-management-services \
    --image=gcr.io/gbl-ist-ve-datadeskvesa/cartographie:latest \
    --set-env-vars="\
    room-dataform=https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/${SPACE_ID}/messages?key=${KEY},\
    room-bigquery=https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/${SPACE_ID}/messages?key=${KEY},\
    location=${DATAFORM_REPO_LOCATION},\
    repository=${DATAFORM_REPO_NAME},\
    workspace=${DATAFORM_WORKPLACE_NAME},\
    notif_dataform_dataset_id=${DATAFORM_DATASET_ID},\
    notif_dataform_table_id=${DATAFORM_TABLE_ID},\
    notif_dataset_id=${NOTIF_DATASET_ID},\
    notif_table_id={NOTIF_BQ_TABLE_ID} \
    --set-env-vars="recipient_emails=${REECEIVER_EMAIL_1}-${REECEIVER_EMAIL_2}-${REECEIVER_EMAIL_3}"
```

## Notes:

- How much time it took?:  

It took approximately three hours of work to complete. However, the entire exercise required more time due to issues with the TikTok-Api. I encountered a problem with the playwright package, which is a dependency for TikTok-Api, and resolving it took about 90 minutes. Additionally, I spent significant time reviewing the TikTok-Api documentation to find an API method that allows fetching user data using a user ID.

- Issues/challenges you faced:  

I encountered numerous issues with the playwright package, a dependency for TikTok-Api. I spent a considerable amount of time identifying that the problem was with the package itself and that only a specific version could resolve it. Additionally, I devoted significant time to reviewing the TikTok-Api documentation to find an API method that allows fetching user data using a user ID.

- database design: 
 
I used SQLite to design my database, creating a single table for storing user information.  

- Possible ways to improve the api:  
A potential improvement for the API would be to utilize the official TikTok APIs.
